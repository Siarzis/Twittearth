# Twittearth
Twittearth is a web application developed as a requirement for Andrew Syrmakesis' diploma thesis.
## Idea
The purpose of this project was to build a method that could track natural disasters (earthquakes, in our case) in Greece through Twitter.
## Notes
By default, FLASK_ENV=development since current version runs on Flask development server. Eventlet has better performance but it is not necessary.
